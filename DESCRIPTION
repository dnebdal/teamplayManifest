Title: Create and parse Manifest files for non-DICOM analysis in Siemens Teamplay
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: c(person("Daniel", "Nebdal", email = "daniel@nebdal.net", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: When uploading a job to Siemens Teamplay, some metadata is required.
  In the original design, this was included in the IDCOM images, but for other data 
  types it needs to be explicitly provided as a HL7 FHIR compatible JSON file.
  This package automates creating and parsing those.
